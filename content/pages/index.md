      As a Scrum Master, I focus on Agile SDLC and methodologies.  I am skilled
      in Project Management, producing high quality metrics along with targeted
      test automation. I have implemented overall operational improvements, best
      practices which have yielded excellent customer reviews.


      My career journey and leadership has been transformative, emphasizing
      project management and test automation to bolster operational standards
      and achieve high-level coverage and confidence in the team's delivery. In
      my 30+ years in the technology space with experience starting as a
      developer to working my way through senior level positions, a teams lead
      to people manager, I have learned the importance of communication,
      strategy, collaboration and best practices.


      I am dedicated to continuous integration and a clean, extensible design.
      With this methodology my leadership has elevated the reliability of the
      company's software applications. I build multiple test automation
      frameworks and adopt systematic methodologies to efficiently tackle
      issues. My servant-leader approach has been instrumental in mentoring and
      expanding a resilient team both on-site and off shore. I have brought the
      team to a position of being poised to meet aggressive project timelines by
      collaborating across teams and with stakeholders. My teams improve quality
      across diverse applications.


      I also encourage consistent learning in both a personal and professional
      environment. As technology changes rapidly, I expect myself and my team to
      be skilled and innovative when it comes to the work we produce.
